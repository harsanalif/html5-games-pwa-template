# html5-games-pwa-template	
[Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) Template for HTML5 Games.

This is a clean and simple template without any dependencies to node/gulp/any build system.
I'm using Phaser 2 games as an example for this project.

I create this project because I can't find a simple and complete working example of PWA for HTML5 games.
This template support Add to Homescreen feature and also removing old cache if newer version available.
